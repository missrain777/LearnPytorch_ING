# LearnPytorch_ING
Hello!This is sean's GitHub website.And this repository recorded the process in which I learned Pytorch.
All these I learned can be found in <a href="https://github.com/fendouai/PyTorchDocs">PyTorchDocs</a>.

<h1 herf="https://github.com/missrain777/LearnPytorch_ING/blob/master/demo.py">demo.py</h1>

The Python file is a demo,which contains a convolutional neural network for image classification.You will see how to define neural networks, compute loss and make updates to the weights of the network.

The dataset is CIFAR10.

We will do the following steps in order:

1.Load and normalizing the CIFAR10 training and test datasets using torchvision

2.Define a Convolutional Neural Network

3.Define a loss function

4.Train the network on the training data

5.Test the network on the test data

The jupyter notebook of the demo is here!
